Moon Base Delta is a 2D space themed dungeon game developed by University of Bath MSc Computer Science students as part of their Software Engineering project. Developed with Python and mainly by using 'Python Arcade' library. Software development process has been a mixture of Scrum, XP and KanBan frameworks.

The game takes place in the near future where mankind has successfully established multiple Moon power plant colonies in order to address a global energy crisis. 
The player assumes the role of a moon base worker who wakes up from an accident only to realise that the whole base has been compromised. The player's primary objective is to successfully escape from Moon Base Delta before the nuclear reactor explodes.

As a player, you will start the game in the storage room but be able to move to different rooms as the game progresses. To aid with navigation, we have included this map to make the layout of the base more clear. 

Tips:

Ensure that you follow the instructions for each task closely, so that you can complete you mission before the oxygen runs out.
